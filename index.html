           <p>The album titled “<strong>Currents</strong>” by the Australian artist <em>Tame Impala</em> is an album that I consider to be my favorite of all time. When Tame Impala is on stage, they are a group of extremely talented musicians. However, Tame Impala is really only made up of a single person named Kevin Parker. Parker writes, records, mixes and masters every element of every song you hear on this record. He does so in his own home-turned-recording-studio. This becomes a remarkable thing to think about when you listen to the album and hear all of its complexities and just how beautifully it is mixed. The album was released in 2015, and it is Tame Impala’s third album coming after their first two, <em>Innerspeaker</em> and <em>Lonerism</em>. The record starts off with a seven minute, forty-six second track titled “Let it Happen”, and this just so happens to be my favorite track on the entire record. The sounds of this track sound as though they almost shouldn’t even exist, as if they were created by some omnipotent being. It just doesn’t seem possible that any human could create a track like this. It is clearly evident that when Kevin Parker is making music, he meticulously spends un measurable amounts of time on each and every element, and this is something you can definitely hear in his music. Even just the high-hat sounds so crystal clear yet it is so mesmerizing, it’s almost as if you can taste the metal of the small cymbal as it reverberates in the song. A song I would compare Let it Happen to perhaps is Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. The song is almost 8 minutes long and has an almost linear progression. It starts fast and in your face, and I think this is deliberate. If you’re listening to this album for the first time, I promise that you’re not expecting what you’re going to hear in the first ten seconds. Despite the fast start, the track has breaks that paint quite the picture with beautiful synthesizers, yet heavy looming bass. Other elements in the track include a record-skipping type of bridge and loud, melodic synths with a melody that will be stuck in your head for days upon listening. You would think that with a track 1 that is this breathtaking, it would only go downhill from there on out. You would be wrong. The rest of the album is made with the same attention to detail and creative genius as Let it Happen, and it keeps you listening until the very end. The cool thing about Tame Impala is that they can do anything from heavily distorted, modulated guitar sounds to beautifully soft synth pads and melodies, while always laying them on top of a beautifully mixed, catchy, completely unique drum beat. I promise you if you listen to the album Currents by Tame Impala, you will not ask for that 51 minutes and 12 seconds of your life back. In fact, I might even go so far as to say you will spend many more 51 minute, 12 seconds periods listening to it again and again.</p>

        <figcaption>Album cover art for <em>The Wall</em> by Pink Floyd</figcaption>
        </figure>
           <p>The album titled “<strong>The Wall</strong>” by the British rock and roll group <em>Pink Floyd</em> is a whopping twenty-six track, one hour and twenty minute LP that is perhaps one of the most dynamic, introspective, philosophic, and even slightly political works ever made. The record was released on November 30th of 1979, and is therefore over forty years old. Despite its age, The Wall remains relevant today in its poetic lyrics and captivating sounds. Pink Floyd is perhaps one of the most dynamic music groups of all time. They have songs that are hard nosed, heavy rock and roll, such as the album’s ninth track <em>Young Lust</em>, and they have songs like <em>Mother</em> that are super soft ballad-like tracks with tear-jerking lyrics that will leave you thinking for days. They have songs like <em>Another Brick in the Wall</em>, a three-part track that is exceedingly dynamic in and of itself, ranging from a rock and roll banger to a story-like track filled with social commentary on the education system, and they have songs like the infamous <em>Comfortably Numb</em>, a psychedelic track about drugs and happiness, loneliness, and perspective. The crazy part is that these tracks are all on the same record. The even crazier part is that every track on the record I haven’t mentioned is completely unique to itself as well. Pink Floyd’s front man David Gilmour is certainly a musical and lyrical genius, a one of a kind talent that will be remembered forever. His lyrics are insightful and beautiful, and his music is entrancing. From the soft melodies and soundscapes to the smooth driven guitar solos, this album will make you feel like you are floating. This album is truly a masterpiece and it will never be touched by anything else. This album is its own genre and there will never be any replication that will ever do justice to the original work. What is also crazy to think about is that (to me, at least) this album is just a hair above some of Pink Floyd’s other albums such as <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> or <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, which are both work of art themselves that showcase Gilmour’s dynamic artistry. Pink Floyd, conceptually, is so far above mostly every other artist to have ever existed. They have works like their 1969 album <em>Ummagumma</em>, that at first listen just sounds like a jumbled mess of different sounds and utter entropy. Basically, it makes absolutely no sense until you do some research. Furthermore, when you do the research, you’re left thinking “wow, who on earth thinks of this stuff”. Pink Floyd seamlessly assigns meaning to the most (seemingly) mundane and meaningless things, and that is true art. When you listen to <em>The Wall</em>, it is certainly a lot to take in. If you really take the time to understand what you’re listening to and look into it a bit, you will truly be able to appreciate it in all its beauty.</p>
