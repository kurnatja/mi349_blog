       <h3>A Short Bio</h3> 
        <p>My name is Jacob Kurnat. I am 21 years old, and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Media and Information with the hopes of becoming a sound engineer. One thing that most people know about me is that I love music. It is hard to pick one genre to call my favorite, so here is a list of some of my favorite genres:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychedelic Rock</li>
                <li>Classic Rock</li>
                <li>Psychedelic Synth Music</li>
                <li>R&B</li>
                <li>Alternative Rock</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This list does not include all my favorite genres as that would be impossible due to the nature of genres themselves, however, I think it gives a pretty good idea of the kind of music I like. In reality, though, I love mostly all music. I appreaciate most music and I love to listen to new music and pick it apart piece by piece. I hope to become a sound engineer because I love mixing music and I hope to be able to find a career that allows me to do that.</p>
